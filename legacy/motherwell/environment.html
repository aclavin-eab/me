	 	<p> Motherwell had many people coming in and out of his life. He married 
	 	four times times; Maria Emilia Ferreira y Moyeros, Betty Little, Helen 
	 	Frankenthaller, and Renate Ponsold. He had two daughters, both he was very close with. In the 
	 	art he was involved with surrealists and dadaists like Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp as 
	 	well as modernist sculptors and abstract expressionists like David Smith and 
	 	Barnet Newman. He was also close friends 
	 	with Clement Greenberg, the champion critic of the New York School, whom 
	 	upon Motherwell’s death proclaimed, &#8220;although he </br>is underrated today, in 
	 	my opinion he was the very best of the Abstract Expressionist painters.&#8221;</p>

	 	<p> Robert Motherwell was born in Auburdeen, Washington. His early education 
	 	was in California, specifically Stanford. Motherwell’s admiration of the 
	 	wide open Pacific spaces can be seen in his painting. At the age 20, he 
	 	traveled in Europe extensively, starting in Paris and ending in Scotland. 
	 	Afterwards he attended Harvard followed by Columbia, where he studied under 
	 	artist Meyer Schapiro. Motherwell spent a period in Mexico, which permanently 
	 	added warm colors to his pallette. Most of his later life was spent on the 
	 	East Coast, eventually passing away in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1991. </p>

		<p> Motherwell was very close friends with Smith, greatly admiring his openness. 
		David was also close friends with Helen Frankenthaler. When Motherwell married Frankenthaler, he 
		recalls that the three of them became a trio with a special dimension. Motherwell had many 
		other friends in the New York School of Abstract Expressionists including Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, and Barnett Newman.

		<p> Robert Motherwell traveled to Mexico in 1941 to follow his mentor at the time,

			<p>&#8220;If I had absolute control of American museums—God forbid!—my first, 
			emergency act would be to install Charles Egan or Clement Greenberg to choose all the 
			works to be shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art; and my second, long-range 
			act would be to redistribute all the great artists, so that each museum, according 
			to its importance, place, and scale would have a preponderance—preferably all—of the works 
			in American public collections of specific artists. I would love to go to San Fransisco, say,
			 to see all the Matisses, to Cambridge for the Sassettas, to Chicago for teh Goyas, to New York for 
			 the Rembrandts, to Merion for Renoirs, or to any small town to see all of a minor artist&#8221;</p>

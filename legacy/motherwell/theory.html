	 	<p> Evident in Motherwell’s writing, he possessed a deep understanding of 
	 	modern art, from Dada to Abstract Expressionism. Motherwell also provided 
	 	valuable insight on subjects such as spirituality, psychology, modernity, 
	 	and the role of the artist. Much of his theory searched for the true 
	 	nature of what was human opposed to the assumptions of social culture.</p>

	 	<p> Motherwell attended a number of prestigious schools in his youth
	 	as a member of the upper class, including Harvard 
	 	and Columbia University. Towards the end of his education his father approached him 
	 	with the question of what he would do with his life. His response being painting disappointed his father,
	 	 but under the condition that he would also teach Motherwell was able to pursue art. He went on to teach at
	  Hunter College, Oberlin, and Brown. 
	 	He was also involved with the renowned Black Mountain College, where his teachings 
	 	inspried the likes of Cy Twombly, Kenneth Noland, and Robert Rauschenberg.</p>

			<p class="quote"> &#8220;And what is modernism, among other things, but the effort 
			to get rid of rhetoric in art?&#8221;</p>
			<p> The meaning and purpose of modernism is a common theme in Motherwell&#8217;s 
			theories. He had serious issues with the state of museums and their power 
			over the relevance of modern art, when museums rarely contain current modern art. At best 
			they had new itirations of what recently was modern art. Motherwell often expressed 
			disgust with the state of other aspects of society from industry to the environment. It could 
			be concluded that he held modern art responsible for ushering into society more 
			appropriate ways of living.

		<p class="quote"> &#8220;The modern artist tends to become the last active spiritual being 
		in the great world. It is true that each artist has his own religion.&#8221;</p>
		<p> Motherwell viewed the artist as a spiritual being living in a material driven world. 
		He held society has turned away form religion through science among other things, but the difference 
		between science and religion was and is major. Religion is a view of the world while science is only 
		a method. Resultingly, religion could not be replaced&mdash;it could only be ignored. This yet another 
		issue with society that the modern artist had the duty of shedding light on.

			 acclaimed art historian by the name of Meyer Schapiro. Schapiro then introduced 
			 Motherwell to Roberto Matta which resulted in Motherwell becoming a part of 
			 the New York School of abstract expressionists, of which he was the youngest

		<p class="quote"> &#8220;Every intelligent painter carries the whole culture of moder painting 
		in </br>his head. It is his real subject, of which anything he paints is both a homage and a critique, 
		and anything </br>he says a gloss.&#8221;</p>
		<p> Much of Motherwell&#8217;s theory revolves around the work of other artists; its importance, flaws,
		and success. Some of his first published work was on Mondrian and Chirico, and there were few artists 
		contemporary to Motherwell that he did not document some theory about. Pollock and Rothko were both 
		championed by Motherwell's words as well as eulogized. Cy Twombly, a student of Motherwell, was heralded 
		as the best modern young painter Motherwell had come in contact with at the Black Mountain college—quite the 
		esteem considering Motherwell's wide circle of artists. It would seem that Motherwell was able to articulate 
		theories on his contemporaries work than those artists themselves.</p>

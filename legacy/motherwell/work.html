	 	<p> Motherwell was most known as a painter, but had a prolific career as 
	 	a printmaker, collagist, writer, and editor. Among his 
	 	paintings, the Elegy to the Spanish series are the most known, cosely 
	 	followed by the Open series. His visual language largely consisted of 
	 	archetypes that he  identified as subconscious element from his past.</p>

		<p> Motherwell was an articulate writer and respected editor. He 
	 	worked on various publications, notably the <em>Documents of Modern Art</em> and <em>The 
	 	Dada Painters and Poets: an Anthology.</em> Through writing he earned the title 
	 	of spokesperson of Abstract Expressionism. Motherwell received grief 
	 	from dealers, galleries, and others for his extensively articulated thoughts&mdash; 
	 	at times he regretted ever writing a single word. </p>

			<p> Motherwell created the Open composition incessently, recalling that the 
			he found the open form clearly in his work even before he purposefully 
			constructed it. It consists of a 
	 	rectangular form in the canvas, seperating it from the rest of the canvas. He 
	 	played with this motif again and again, exploring the beauty of its simple form.</p>

			<p> One of Motherwell&#8217;s most famous painting series </br>was his Ellegies to the 
	 	Spanish Republic. This series consisted of black vertical bands and circles. 
	 	It was visually representative of freedom and restraint, an expression with 
	 	the Spanish revolution in mind. Over time as the series matured, they became 
	 	about more universal concepts, no longer only addressing the dead Spanish Republic.</p>

	 	<p> Throughout his career Motherwell often used collage within his paintings 
	 	and, specifically in his later work, on their own. Working with collage allowed 
	 	him to evoke a highly hugman feeling in his composition with more ease 
	 	than a painting.</p>
